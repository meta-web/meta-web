## Current web issues

Current web developed into multimedia platform for information exchange. But this brings many issues.

### 1. Web applications and user interfaces

Nowdays web consists of many HTML + CSS and JavaScript files which together presents information. Recently many web applications (instead of websites) are appearing in a current web. These applications creates various user interfaces and users has to learn how to interact with each application. Lot of code must be written and applications are using heavy frameworks to reach it's purpose as opposite to mobile applications which are built upon standard components specific for every platform.

### 2. DIV flooding

Most of HTML contents consists of DIV (and another) tags which have one general purpose - design and user interface instead of information meaning. Original purpose of web is to present information and data, not graphic design.

### 3. Machine readability

Current web applications and pages are difficult to process by machines and they lack semantic meaning. Each application has different API and is difficult to interconnect them, automatize workflow and generally use them together effectively.

### 4. Non-standard based on standard

Many APIs, frameworks and protocols were developed over standard web technologies. But they are too proprietary and different so it is difficult to interconnect them as one cooperative network which was original purpose of a web.

### 5. IoT (internet of things)

New trend where many hardware devices will be connected to network. But there is no standard which defines how to access and control them. As each router, phone, sensor has it's own proprietary API and web interface.
