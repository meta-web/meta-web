## Solution

Solution to this problem is to create new protocols and formats which will represent information and its meaning in context. These formats should be machine readable and web browsers should display them as web applications with single general user interface which every user can learn easily.

### Technical background

MetaWEB concept is based on standard HTTP protocol, REST methodology and another modern web technologies such as Web events for live data updates.

Goal of this project is to define new standard which will be used instead of HTML (HTML will be still used but for hypermedia and text) and will represent information relations and content in machine and humman readable way.
