MetaWeb formats represents information by putting data into context.

**UI representable**  
MetaWeb formats describes data in a way that it can be simply visualise in user interface by browser or another applications.

**Machine readable**  
JSON based formats provides easy way to process meta data.

**Actionable resources**  
Every resource can define actions so they can be visualised by UI or processed by another applications. This feature also provides opportunity for IoT where real-life objects as lights or thermostats can be controlled. Another benefit is voice-controlled interfaces where resources can be identified as objects with actions.
