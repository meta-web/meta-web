I can't remember when it started first. Few years ago when I was started to developing our company information system I was begun to see many issues and redundant work in way how web applications are being developed. And since then I was perceiving these issues more and more. About two years ago the idea of META Web was born. I was developing it privately until today when I decided to publish it to broader audience.

## What is META Web?

META Web is a concept of web technology which is defining API protocols and UI markup language to change a way how web applications are being developed nowadays. To improve development and communication between web services and user interfaces.
