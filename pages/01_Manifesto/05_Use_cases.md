## META Web use cases

I see potential of META Web in many fields. From multiplatform applications, e-commerce solutions, intranet systems, blogs, websites to IoT and embedded devices.

### Web and mobile applications

This area doesn't need any comment because it is primary field and reason why META Web concept has been created.

### Web presentations

Nowadays classic websites look more like a web or mobile applications. Even blogs or online shops are form of web application which communicates with a server and interacts with a user.

But there may be a problem with design and marketing requirements. I'm explaining this issue below.

### Web services

As I mentioned in META API section - web services and applications are communicating together more a more. Many people is saying that we are in API economy era. Also microservices are becoming very popular. META Web can provide effective solution for service integration.

### Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices

IoT is becoming popular topic and we don't have any standards yet (companies are working on it).

What if you buy a smart thermostat device which is using META Web technology? You will get:

- Desktop / mobile / tablet app - user interface based on META UI
- Possibility to easily integrate device with another apps or services using META API

And all this without installing any additional software or studying vendor specific API documentation.

This also applies for many other devices such as network devices, home data storages, TVs or smart home devices.
