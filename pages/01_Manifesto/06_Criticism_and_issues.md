## Criticism and possible issues

Before you start asking questions read this FAQ first.

### Why not use current technologies such as Web components and other HTML5 stuff?

One simple reason - performance. Image that all code required for META UI will be written as classic web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then try to use this app on average smartphone. Ok, it doesn't run much smoothly. And so much code which has to be loaded.

Another argument is use of META Web in embedded devices which haven't much performance.

And we are trying to avoid a need to use complex frameworks. Also native META Web support will bring better integration to each platform.

### Universal concept cannot cover all use cases

That's true. Many various components have to specified and implements such as charts, map views, workflow editors or conversation component for chats.

But concept counts with very specific needs. META UI will provide capability to use standard web technologies to create apps which can be then integrated into view. But this won't be mandatory. For example embedded browser can omit this features due to performance reasons.

### It's really bad that we cannot create nice colorfull designs, how can we do marketing stuff then?

Yes! META Web is killer of graphic designers and marketing. But it's not so hot, really.

When you look at modern websites you can see that they look like mobile applications. They have minimalistic and clear design. Why? Because many people are accessing web using mobile phones or tablets and a goal of UX designers is to provide comfortable interaction similar to native mobile platform.

And how is design made in mobile apps? In no special way. By creating meaningful layout and by using nice images and icons. And META UI provides exactly same capabilities.

### It has no chance to succeed

I partially agree with that. META Web is futuristic and maybe utopic concept. But only when its primary goal would be to change a way how web applications are made and how we interact with the web. But this not means that META Web would not be usable for effective development of business applications.

Only time will show.
