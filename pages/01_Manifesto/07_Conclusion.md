## Conclusion

My goal is to solve problems that bother me as a web developer and I see META Web as a solution.

This project is being developed as open-source and I would like to invite other developers to contribute. Maybe right people will find this project and it will become a global web standard.

Personally I think that if it won't be the META Web then another simmilar technology will be created in a future which will be solving same problems.

This manifesto is really only a small introduction to my concept. I'am discussing concept details on a [forum](http://flarum.metahub.cloud/) and API and UI specifications will be added over time.

PS: Sorry for not so gramatically correct english, contributions are welcome :)
