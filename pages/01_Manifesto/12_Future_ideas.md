## Future ideas

I would like to list future ideas of META Web which are not important now.

META Web can also provide:

- Unified identity between services - Would like to use facebook, twitter, google or other services which you have your social profile on to connect your identity to any service? Use unified META API.

- Data sharing - META Web would provide a way how to share data between services or clients - you can fill part of a form then send it to you friend who can fill rest and can send it back to you.

- Voice interaction - applications using META Web unified API can be easily controlled by a voice, mainly when developer provides enough description in schema, also META dictionary can help clients to understand common actions.

- Artificial intelligence - META Web service schemas are all machine readable, why not to create an intelligent agent which can interact with your services using intelligence.
