## What is the META Web?

The META Web is a concept of a technology which aims to solve the following problems of the current web platform:

1. Diverse and proprietary APIs which prevents effective implementation and communication between web services and applications
2. A need to use complicated web frameworks for application development to do simple things
3. Repetition of same data model definitions across application layers
4. A lot of redundant work and code overall

## Solution?

The generic **META API** with a descriptive meta-layer which provides transferable definitions of dynamic data model in all application layers including external web services. The result is lower risk of errors and simplified development.

The generic **META UI** markup language for defining multiplatform UIs using a standardized component model which is connected to META API data sources. It leads to no need to define data fields manually. Developers control only layout and visual details which also simplifies overall development.

These components provide a simple platform for effective development of web services and applications for desktop, mobile and IoT and thereby reduce development costs.
