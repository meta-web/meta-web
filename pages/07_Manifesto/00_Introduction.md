I can't remember when it first started. A few years ago when I started developing our company information system I begin to see many issues and redundant work in the way how web applications were being developed. And from that moment I was noticing these issues more and more frequently. About two years ago the idea of META Web was born. I was developing it privately until today when I decided to publish it to a broader audience.
