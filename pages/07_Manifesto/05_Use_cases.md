## META Web use cases

I see the potential of the META Web in many fields. From multiplatform applications, e-commerce solutions, intranet systems, blogs, websites to IoT and embedded devices.

### Web and mobile applications

This area doesn't need any comment because it is the primary field and reason why the META Web concept has been created.

### Web presentations

Nowadays classic websites look more like web or mobile applications. Even blogs or online shops are form of a web application which communicates with a server and interacts with a user.

But there may be a problem with design and marketing requirements. I'm explaining the issue below.

### Web services

As I mentioned in the META API section - web services and applications communicate with each other more and more. Many people say that we are in the API economy era. Also microservices are becoming very popular. THe META Web can provide an effective solution for a service integration.

### Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded devices

The IoT is becoming a popular topic and we don't have any standards yet (many companies are working on it).

What if you buy a smart thermostat device which is using the META Web technology? You will get:

- Desktop / mobile / tablet app - a user interface based on the META UI
- Possibility to easily integrate the device with another apps or services using the META API

And all this without installing any additional software or studying a vendor specific API documentation.

This also applies for many other devices such as network devices, home data storages, TVs or smart home devices.
