## Criticism and possible issues

Before you start asking questions read this FAQ first.

### Why not to use current web technologies such as Web components and other HTML5 stuff?

One simple reason - performance. Imagine that all code required for the META UI written as a classic web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then try to use this app on an average smartphone. Ok, it doesn't run much smoothly. And so much code which has to be loaded.

Another argument is use of the META Web in embedded devices which haven't much performance.

And we try to avoid the need to use complex frameworks. Also a native META Web support can bring a better integration to each platform.

### Universal concept cannot cover all use cases

That's true. Many various components need to be specified and implemented such as charts, map views, workflow editors or a conversation component for chats.

But the concept counts with very specific needs. The META UI will provide a capability to use standard web technologies to create custom apps which can be integrated into the META UI view. But this won't be mandatory. For example an embedded browser can omit these features due to performance reasons.

### It's really bad if we cannot create nice, rich and colorful designs, how can we do marketing stuff then?

Yes! The META Web is killer of graphic designers and marketing. But it's not so hot, really.

When you look at modern websites you can see that they look like mobile applications. They have a minimalistic and clear design. Why? Because many people access web using mobile phones or tablets and a goal of UX designers is to provide comfortable interaction similar to a native mobile platform.

And how a design is made in mobile apps? In a no special way. By creating a meaningful layout and by using nice images and icons. And the META UI provides exactly the same capabilities.

### It has no chance to succeed

I partially agree with that. The META Web is the futuristic and maybe utopic concept. But only if its primary goal would be to change a way how web applications are being made and how we interact with the web. But this not means that the META Web would not be usable for effective development of business applications.

Only time will tell.
