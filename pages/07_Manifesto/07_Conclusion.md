## Conclusion

My goal is to solve problems that bother me as a web developer and I see the META Web as a solution.

This project is being developed as an open-source and I would like to invite other developers to contribute. Maybe right people will find this project and it will become a global web standard.

Personally, I think that if it won't be the META Web then another similar technology will be created in the future which will be solving the same problems.

This manifesto is really only a small introduction to my concept. I'm discuss concept details on a [forum](http://flarum.metahub.cloud/) and the API and UI specifications will be added over time.

This manifesto is also [available in czech as my original blog post](http://jiri.hybek.cz/META-Web-1-Manifest/).

You can also [browse an old META Web specification](http://old.metahub.cloud/) I've been working on. Current work is based on these specs.
