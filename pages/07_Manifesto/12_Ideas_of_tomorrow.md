## Ideas of tomorrow

I would like to list future ideas of the META Web which are not important now.

**META Web can also provide:**

- A unified identity between services - Would you like to use the Facebook, Twitter, Google or other services which you have your social profile on to connect your identity to any service? Use the unified META API.

- Data sharing - The META Web can provide a way how to share data between services or clients - you can fill part of a form then send it to you friend who can fill the rest and can send it back to you.

- Voice interaction - Applications using the META Web unified API can be easily controlled by a voice, mainly when developer provides enough description in a schema, also the META dictionary can help clients to understand common actions.

- Artificial intelligence - The META Web service schemas are all machine readable, why not to create an intelligent agent which can interact with your services using intelligence.
