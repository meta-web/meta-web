## Information for partners

We are looking for long-term partners and supporters - companies or individuals. Because we know that every industry has specific needs we would like to integrate into the META Web concept. We are also looking for partnership in areas of a META Web development (contributors) and a media propagation.

**As a partner you can support this project in following areas:**

- **Development** - Contribute to the development of the concept and API/UI libraries
- **Technological partnership** - Tell us about your industry needs and integrate META Web into your products
- **Media partners** - Support META Web with articles, tweets or other media content
- **Funding** - Fund the development of the META Web concept and related technologies and libraries

We also plan to establish a non-profit organization to lead the concept development. Our major partners will then be able to become legal members of this organization.

To become our partner contact us via an e-mail [info (at) metahub.cloud](#mail-link) or a phone (see above).
